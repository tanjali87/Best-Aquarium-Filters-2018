## Best Aquarium Filters Reviews!

This file exists, all right. In fact, I wrote it for the world to see. If you've [installed keybase](https://keybase.io/download) you can see this file at `/keybase/public/chris/index.md`.

And YES, it works. When I edit index.md on my own computer, these sites all instantly update:

  - https://chris.keybase.pub/index.md - *this file served as raw markdown*
  - https://keybase.pub/chris/index.md - *this file inside a glossy, navigable site*
  - https://chris.keybase.pub - *this file rendered as HTML*

If you're testing the Keybase filesystem, this will all work for you, too.

#### How it works

  - [keybase.pub](https://keybase.pub) is just a dumb site that serves things straight out of `/keybase/public`.
  - It's not privileged in any way.
  - EVERY DAY IS AN ADVENTURE.  (▱˘◡˘▱)
